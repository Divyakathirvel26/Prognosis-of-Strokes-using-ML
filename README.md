A stroke is a medical disorder in which there is insufficient blood supply to the brain, resulting in cell death. It is currently a leading cause of death throughout the world. By inspecting the affected individuals, several risk variables believed to be associated to the cause of stroke have been discovered. 
A lot of studies have been conducted using these risk factors to predict and diagnose stroke disorders. The majority of the models rely on data mining and machine learning algorithms. 
I have employed four machine learning algorithms in this study to detect the type of stroke that could occur or has occurred based on a person's physical state and medical report data.
The classification result indicates that the outcome is satisfactory and that it can be utilized in a real-time medical report. The machine learning algorithms can aid in illness knowledge and serve as a useful healthcare companion.
